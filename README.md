BUILD A CAR

This is class project for General Assembly's (GA) JavaScript Circuit online course.

Using GA HTML/CSS/JS starter code my goal was to build a website that allows the user
to build a car.  The user can specify a model, color and option.  The application will
keep track of the information and display a running cost for the car the user built.

A live site was provided that visually showed what the site should look like and how it should function.
